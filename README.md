## About

The Lab3 project is a student's laboratory work on the topic of **dynamic arrays (one-dimensional and jagged)** in C#. The documentation explains the structure, implementation approach, and processing logic for both types of arrays. It is intended to serve as a reference for understanding the implemented functionality.

The documentation is based on the following topics from the original project:

- Initialization and transformation of one-dimensional arrays
- Insertion and removal of elements from one-dimensional arrays
- Initialization and manipulation of jagged arrays
- Handling of specific array conditions and use cases

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

- General description of the lab task
- API reference for methods and data structures
- Code structure and logic

## Tools Used

- [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) – for generating static documentation from source code and markdown files
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) – for publishing the generated documentation
- C#, F#, VB – core programming languages used in the implementation
